This website is a spin-off from tinder. A way for dogs to meet other furry friends!

If you don’t have friends or family with dogs of their own, the most obvious place for your canine to make friends is the local dog park. However, because these are public places, it’s important to consider safety by being alert to your surroundings and the other dogs at the park. However, some dogs dont always get along with random dogs, due to intimidation, temperment, and size. TinDog is here to find a match for your furry friend!

Playing with other dogs as well as with humans can be an important part of achieving that well-being. It’s true that some dogs, due to breed, a poor upbringing or lack of socialization early in life, don’t get on well with others of their own kind. But most dogs thrive on regular play dates with canine friends. In fact, not getting enough playtime with other canines can be detrimental to these dogs.
